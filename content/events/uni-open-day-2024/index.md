abstract: |
  During the lecture, we will explore how three-dimensional models can be generated from images and what types of spatial information can be extracted from image data. We will provide an overview of the theory of spatial (3D) vision. Through case studies, we will demonstrate the quality of models that can be obtained from camera images. The lecture will cover general reconstruction methods, processing data from vehicle-mounted cameras, as well as high-precision structured-light reconstruction, which is widely used in industrial applications.
  Lecturers: Dr. Levente Hajder, Senior Research Fellow, Department of Algorithms and Their Applications, ELTE Faculty of Informatics; Tekla Tóth, PhD student, Department of Algorithms and Their Applications
