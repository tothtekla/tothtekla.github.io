  This paper introduces a novel camera-LiDAR calibration method using a simple planar chessboard pattern as the calibration object. We propose a special mounting for the sensors when only one rotation angle should be estimated for the calibration. It is proved that the calibration can optimally be solved in the least-squares sense even if the problem is overdetermined, i.e., when many chessboard patterns are visible for the sensors. The accuracy and precision of our unique solution are validated on both simulated and real-world data.
