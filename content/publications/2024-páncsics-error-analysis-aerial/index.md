abstract: |
  This paper presents a thorough analysis of precision and sensitivity in aerial image-based relative object position estimation, exploring factors such as camera tilt, 3D projection error, marker misalignment, rotation and calibration error. Our unique contribution lies in simulating complex 3D geometries at varying camera altitudes (20-130 m). The simulator has a built-in unique mathematical model offering an extensive set of error parameters to improve reliability of aerial image-based position estimation in practical applications.
