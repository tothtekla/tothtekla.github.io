  This paper deals with robust surface fitting on spatial points measured by a
  LiDAR device. The point clouds contain hundreds of thousands data points.
  Therefore, the time demand of the algorithms is crucial for fast operation. We present
  two novel algorithms based on the RANSAC method: one for plane detection and one
  for other object detection. The execution time of the novel algorithms is
  significantly lower as only one random sampling is required because a deterministic
  technique selects the other data points. The accuracy of the novel methods are
  validated on synthesized data as well as real indoor and outdoor measurements.
