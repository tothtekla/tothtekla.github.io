abstract: Automatic sensor calibration is ubiquitous for robots and autonomous vehicles. Traditional target-based calibration methods typically require multiple registrations of an object in the field of view. However, by moving the object continuously while recording, the 3D positions of the target generate a path that may improve the calibration quality. In this work, we propose a novel curve-based trajectory registration method to enhance calibration accuracy with spherical and checkerboard targets. This approach supplements the existing target position point set with estimated intermediate points after applying spline fitting techniques to the measurements. The curvature of the movement is aligned between the point sets resulting in reduced error between the registered point clouds and more accurate extrinsic calibration parameters. We validate these properties in indoor and outdoor real-world scenarios.
